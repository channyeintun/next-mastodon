# Next.js Frontend For Mastodon

A minimal, performant social media frontend for Mastodon built with Next.js 16 and modern React patterns.

## Browser Requirements

**⚠️ Important:** This project uses modern CSS patterns with limited browser availability and recently established baseline features. For the best experience and to showcase all features properly, please use the **latest version of Chrome** or other Chromium-based browsers.
